##Overview
The general purpose of our project was to create a helper program for a small business looking to broaden their financial options.  The project was divided into two parts, with the first part being a HTML webpage which prompts the user for inputs for the Black-Scholes model.  The second part was stock modeling using a Monte Carlo method along with other simulations.  The end product of the project was a small simulator to help a small business grow through the use of different financial models and simulations.

##Concepts Demonstrated
Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. 
* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.
* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.

##External Technology and Libraries
Briefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).

##Favorite Scheme Expressions
####MSridhar
Each team member should identify a favorite expression or procedure, written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody?
Remember code looks something like this:
```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)
```
####Behailu
This expression reads in a regular expression and elegantly matches it against a pre-existing hashmap....
```scheme
(let* ((expr (convert-to-regexp (read-line my-in-port)))
             (matches (flatten
                       (hash-map *words*
                                 (lambda (key value)
                                   (if (regexp-match expr key) key '()))))))
  matches)
```
